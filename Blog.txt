In my final project at Flatiron Bootcamp, I made a React app. When I first started going to Bootcamp and I looked through the curriculum, this was the only project I was kind of worried about. Up until that point, I had already known some HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails so I was excited about making projects to show that off. But when it came to React and especially Redux, it was like a whole new way of thinking about web design. Now that I have learned the frameworks I have a great deal of respect for this type of design. If I were to create a full-stack application, no matter what the backend was, I would deeply consider using React. If the project was small I would probably leave out Redux, but if I knew that the app was going to grow big, having a state manager like Redux is a huge help.
