# City Info (front end)
An App that uses API calls to get location data, weather for current, 10 day and 12 hour, local restaurants, and local events.
Used HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Redux, Ruby on Rails

## Usage
I would recommend starting the backend using rails s -p 3001, then the front
yarn start. The front end expects the server to be on port 3001.
